\section{Conclusion}
The proposed management model is well-thought and effectively abstracts any potential complexities by using a Distributed Object-Oriented Database approach as opposed to a Centralized approach. This has proven to give the prototype flexible, reliable and scalable in the complex IPv4/IPv6 network environments. This seperation of concerns successfully solves the problem of the co-existence of the IPv4 and IPv6 protocols and minimizes the complexity of this consensus.
