\section{Introduction}
	\paragraph{In world of rapidly developing technologies a centralized architecture that IPv4 uses is no longer sufficient. Flexibility, reliability and scalability are key to moving forward. A distributed object oriented network management model has been proposed to accommodate the transition from IPv4 to IPv6. 
The passage outlines the key concepts of such a transition and explores the components that are used to achieve this.}
